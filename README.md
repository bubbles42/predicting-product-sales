This project is all about predict business sales

## Initial Analysis Findings

![week3_projext_heatmap](https://github.com/bubbles42/predicting-product-sales/assets/115664524/2c57bb79-c349-4170-89a1-1d48238c75de)

The above heatmap shows us the correlation between the numeric columns. There are not really any negative correlations that stand out, but a few positive ones. For instance, Item Weight and Outlet Establishment Year and Item MRP and Item Outlet Sales have positive correlations. After further inspection, the most important correlation is to predict the MRP sales.

Based on this graph, our items are priced in the 100-200 dollar range for the majority of items. No real correlation, though, between count and item price.
