This project is all about predict business sales

## Initial Analysis Findings

![week3_projext_heatmap](https://github.com/bubbles42/predicting-product-sales/assets/115664524/2c57bb79-c349-4170-89a1-1d48238c75de)

The above heatmap shows us the correlation between the numeric columns. There are not really any negative correlations that stand out, but a few positive ones. For instance, Item Weight and Outlet Establishment Year and Item MRP and Item Outlet Sales have positive correlations. After further inspection, the most important correlation is to predict the MRP sales.
